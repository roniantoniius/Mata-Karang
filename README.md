# Mata-Karang

MATA KARANG is a web-based application that can collect data about coral reefs in Indonesian waters and can identify whether coral reef health is affected by bleaching or not. In addition, there are educational features and information about coral reefs such as unique classification of coral reefs, information related to coral reefs affected by bleaching, the number of coral reefs (species, genus, genera and family), methods of collecting and sending photographic data in understanding health and diversity, information related to the level/condition of bleaching (bleching) on coral reefs, and analysis of coral images found on 5 islands in Indonesia ranging from Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua. The MATA KARANG website adopts the concept of Deep Learning, by referring to the latest research in coral reef damage detection using the ResNet-50 model. Additional features such as island-by-island analysis, coral reef information sharing communities, bleaching potential maps and restoration recommendations for damaged locations, are added values that this application carries in supporting the conservation and restoration of coral reef ecosystems in Indonesia.

Through the 'Mata Karang' website as an innovative open source platform with deep learning methods for analyzing and monitoring coral health in Indonesia, we not only encourage the sustainability of coral reefs, but also support the concept of integrated coastal area management. With open access to coral health data and information, stakeholders such as government, researchers, and communities can work together in designing sustainable coastal area management strategies that involve various sectors to maintain marine biodiversity and support sustainable marine resources.
